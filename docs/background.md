I am always striving to be broaden my knowledge and sharpen my skills. I love working in environment with lots of challenges and brilliant people to share those challenges with. I am very passionate about programming. I have keen eye for new paradigms and architecture. Though I am comfortable in one language, I also like to explore new languages. I also like indulging my time with my pet projects and participating in hackathons also i like to stay updated with the latest technologies.

As a self learner, I started programming from mid of 2012, started from PHP and then HTML, CSS, Javascript. Learned it for a whole day of 2013 and then I started learning android and java from 2014-2015.In between this years, i also learned database, networking and built projects like a clone of google adsense and google analytics, android mobile games and apps, windows desktop software. On March 2015 I got my first job and started working with team.
