## Overview

Visualizing data isn’t just about plotting numbers—it’s about telling stories that users can grasp at a glance. In this post, I’ll break down how I used **Recharts** in combination with **Tailwind CSS** and **Mantine** to create responsive, branded, and insightful charts for political and historical datasets.

My goal was to make charts that could:

* Compare performance across time (votes, seats, etc.)
* Use party logos as data points
* Display multilingual tooltips
* Work on mobile and large screens without losing meaning

## Why Recharts?

I chose Recharts for its simplicity and flexibility with React. It provides composable chart primitives and integrates nicely with controlled components and hooks.

I needed to:

* Overlay multiple data series
* Show custom markers (like logos instead of dots)
* Render responsive SVG
* Integrate with my component styling (Tailwind + Mantine)

Recharts was the sweet spot between ease and power.

## Custom Features I Built

### 1. **Party Logos as Dot Markers**

I replaced the default `dot` in `<LineChart>` with a custom React component that loads and renders each party’s logo based on `partyId`:

```tsx
<Line dot={<LogoDot />} ... />
```

This added personality to the chart and helped users instantly recognize which party was being represented.

### 2. **Dynamic Tooltips with Localized Labels**

Using my dual-language model, tooltips display data in English or Nepali depending on the current language:

```tsx
<Tooltip content={<LocalizedTooltip />} />
```

The `LocalizedTooltip` uses `i18next` context and party metadata to show:

* Party name
* Year
* Vote % or Seat %

---

### 3. **Trend Arrows and Visual Cues**

I injected mini arrows or icons next to each data point to indicate rise, fall, or flat trend compared to the last election. This was a subtle but powerful visual hint:

```tsx
const trendIcon = trend > 0 ? "↑" : trend < 0 ? "↓" : "→";
```

### 4. **Responsiveness with Tailwind Grid + Flex**

Using Tailwind’s responsive classes, I wrapped the charts in cards and constrained them with max-widths, padding, and scroll behavior for mobile:

```tsx
<div className="p-4 max-w-full overflow-x-auto">
  <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
    <LineChart ... />
  </ResponsiveContainer>
</div>
```

## Things to Watch Out For

* Recharts doesn’t handle large datasets well unless memoized or chunked.
* Logos should be sized and cached to avoid layout shifts.
* Tooltips can become overwhelming—focus on key values only.
* Always test with real-world edge cases (missing years, duplicated values).

## Takeaways

Recharts allowed me to build custom, beautiful charts quickly. With a bit of Tailwind and React, I added personality to the numbers—something that static charts can’t offer.

If you’re visualizing time-series or comparative data in a frontend app, start with the basics but leave room for personalization. Icons, context-aware labels, and responsive design make a huge difference.
