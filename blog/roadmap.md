## 2025 Series: Architecture, Retrospectives, and Advanced Logic

### End-to-End Architecture of a Public Analytics Platform
- Planned: 2025-07-10
- A holistic architectural review, including data pipeline design, deployment strategy, separation of concerns, and monitoring infrastructure.

### Lessons Learned: Scaling a Data-Rich Fullstack Project Solo
- Planned: 2025-08-05
- Honest review of what worked, what didn't, technical decisions reconsidered, and managing development pace when you're the builder and planner.


## Optional Series: DevOps, AI Readiness, and Domain Reflections

### Dockerizing a Fullstack Monorepo: Lessons from Production
- Planned: 2025-09
- How Docker was used in local and production environments to isolate services and manage environment configurations cleanly.

### Monitoring a Live Platform with Zabbix, ELK, and Prometheus
- Planned: 2025-10

### Modeling Time-Based Events: Tenures, Roles, and Switches
- Planned: 2025-11
- Details the domain design around time-scoped relationships and how switching behavior was encoded with start/end dates and enums.

### Preparing a Data Platform for AI Agents and LLM Integration
- Planned: 2025-12
- Discusses how normalized, structured data can be used by future LLM agents and what patterns make querying easier and safer.

### Why Structured Data Matters for Civic Platforms
- Planned: 2026-01
- Reflection on the broader value of structured, accessible, and multilingual data for transparency, accountability, and open access.
