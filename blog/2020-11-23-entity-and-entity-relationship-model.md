**Entity type**: It defines a collection of similar entities.

Types of entity type are as follows:

- **_Strong entity_**: Strong entity means an entity which has primary key and it doesn’t depend on other entities for existence. It is also known a parent entity.

- **_Composite entity_**: Composite entity is used to make a Many to Many relationship between 2 or more entities. This entity is composed of primary keys from each of the connected entities.
